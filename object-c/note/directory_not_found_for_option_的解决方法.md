# Directory not found for Option 的解决方法

	Also, just in case if one day you re-encounter one of the two following warning messages, just remember that you will have to do that: if the warning is for option '-L/...' that is Library Search Paths, delete the stuff there. However if the warning is for option '-F/...' that is Framework Search Paths, delete the stuff there.
	
	—L 的时候 在Library Search Paths这里找到不存在的类，删了就行
	-F 的时候 在Framework Search Paths 删了就行
